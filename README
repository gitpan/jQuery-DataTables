pod2text jQuery::DataTables.pm > README

If this is still here it means the programmer was too lazy to create the readme file.

You can create it now by using the command shown above from this directory.

At the very least you should be able to use this set of instructions
to install the module...

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.
